**Glass configurations:**

For each system studied, 10 representative configurations of the glass phase have been obtained and studied. These configurations are published here in CIF format:

- [`ZIF4`](ZIF4/) folder: glass formed for ZIF-4
- [`ZIF8`](ZIF8/) folder: glass formed from ZIF-8
- [`SALEM2`](SALEM2/) folder: glass formed from SALEM-2
