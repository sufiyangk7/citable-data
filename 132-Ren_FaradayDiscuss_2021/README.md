**Scripts:**

- The github repository used to generate the data from the paper can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/eren125/material-screening"> Here</a>. Links to the Raspa software, Zeo++ software and the CoReMOF Database are given in the ```README.md``` of the repository. You can clone the repository and install the required softwares and packages to reproduce the work.
- In the ```Scripts/``` directory, you can find an example of script to make grids, widom insertions and multi-component GCMC calculations (always generate the grids before making any calculations to gain time). Please change the path to the ```material-screening``` directory of your installation.

**Database:**

- All the results on CoReMOF are saved within a CSV file in ```Database/Screening_CoReMOF_Dataset.csv```. You can visualize them with the tools of your choice.
