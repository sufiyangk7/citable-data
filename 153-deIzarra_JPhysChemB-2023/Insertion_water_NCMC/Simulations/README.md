- In `NVT_equilibration`: equilibration of a system of 148 water molecules by NVT MC simulation is performed with RASPA. The final configuration is stored in `RestartInitial`.
- In `NCMC_chemical_potential_water`, I copied `NVT_equilibration/RestartInitial` that is used as the initial configuration to perform NCMC simulation that calculate the alchemical work associated with insertion of two water molecules. The output is the `Alchemical_work.txt` file with the list of Alchemical work calculated during the MC simulation and decomposition between electrostatic and vdW part. This file is analysed with `main.cpp` to calculate the excess part of chemical potential of water solvation.
