- For each system: `NVT_simulation` is equilibration of systems of water molecules and CsCl salt ions by NVT MC simulation is performed with RASPA. The final configuration is stored in `RestartInitial`.
- In `NCMC_chemical_potential_alchemical_transformation`, I copied the above `RestartInitial` that is used as the initial configuration to perform NCMC simulation that calculate the alchemical work associated with alchemical transformation of water molecules into a pair of CsCl electrolyte unit. The output is `AlchemicalWork.txt` file with the list of Alchemical work calculated during the MC simulation. This file is analysed in `main.cpp` to calculate the chemical potential of ion exchange.
